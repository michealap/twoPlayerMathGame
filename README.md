## Description

A 2-player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

Both players start with 3 lives. Answer incorrectly, lose a life. At the end of every turn, the game outputs the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game continues until one of the players loses all of their lives. At this point, the game announces who won and scores.
